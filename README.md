# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The client Louise needs to obtain at least $10,000 of funding to launch her play "Fever" and has decided to seek the capital through a crowdfunding initiative.  She has asked us to help identify attributes of historically successful campaigns and provide her recommendations on how to structure her crowdfunding to increase the likelihood of it being a success.

### Purpose:
- Use data on the success and failure of historical crowdfunding initiatives to provide analysis of outcomes based on their attributes
- Provide Louise recommendations on how to structure her initiative to increase likelihood of success
- Identify gaps with current dataset and other visualizations or analysis that might provide additional insights

## Analysis and Challenges
There are a number of decisions Louise needs to make regarding the nature of the crowdfunding, including, but not limited to:
- *Time of year to launch the initiative*: does launching at a specific time mean the project is lost in a large volume of similar requests vs. launch at a time of year when supporters aren't as motivated to give?
- *Target funding goal*: does Louise ask for an amount that is achievable but that might not cover all costs vs. ask for more than what she might need (contingency funds) but potentially dissuade backers from donating to a project that seems unachievable?
- *Target geography*: where should Louise seek funding, based on a country's taste in the content of plays in general, to garner more financial support?
- *Title and description*: can Louise change how she markets the play in order to attract more backers?

Decision #3 is not a feasible option if Louise is unable to travel in order to launch her play.  And while she can modify the marketing content of the play in the crowdfunding page, it would require more advanced analytical techniques (text mining) and the data might be too dissimilar to provide any actionable insights.  Decisions 1 and 2 are much easier to influence given the available data for this analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
First I conducted analysis on the success of theater-fcused crowdfunding initiatives to determine if there is a target month in which launching the crowdfunding might prove more successful.  This could give Louise the option of delaying or accelerating the project if it would mean a significantly higher probability of hitting target funding, at least based on historical trends.

By using the provided data set and summarizing the success/failure/canceled project counts by month, we get the following table:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
